          <p>I'm insanely enthusiastic about <a class="extra-special" href="http://passion-projects.github.com/">Passion Projects</a>, an initiative by <a href="https://github.com/nrrrdcore">Julie Ann Horvath</a> and <a href=https://github.com/">Github</a> to highlight 'Incredible Women In Tech'</p> 
          <p>I even got to participate! My Passion Project for several years has been growing <a href="#railsbridge">RailsBridge</a>, in a way that lets us expand around the world, make the best use of volunteers, and, because it's an all-volunteer organization, create ways for new people to jump in and contribute immediately without needing anyone's permission. My talk at GitHub focused on the examples of leaderless organizations that inspired us.</p>
          <p>The GitHub Streaming Eagles <a class="video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMYUGwQGLn8">recorded</a> the talk for posterity, and afterwards, Julie directed a <a class="doc" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GeKarLwfqA">short documentary</a> about how I got started and how RailsBridge is kinda changing the world.

          <h2>Scottish Ruby Conference 2013</h2>
          <p>The first year I attended SRC (2010), Jim Weirich gave an amazing keynote about working through <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">The Structure and Interpreation of Computer Programs</a>. When I got home, I started a study group to do the same thing. It was just as educational as Jim said. 
          <p>The next year I attended (2012), <a href="https://twitter.com/bjelline"> Brigitte Jellinek</a>, a friend and one of the only academic instructors teaching Rails in 2012, cajoled me into giving a lightning talk with her; she spoke about teaching in an academia and I spoke about teaching at RailsBridge.</p>
          <p>In 2013, <a href="https://twitter.com/alancfrancis">Alan</a>, one of the SRC organizers, asked me to give a real talk, a keynote, even! I had recently been inspired by a great history of programming, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Engineers-Scientists-Iconoclasts-Programmers-Revolution/dp/0465042260">GOTO, by Steve Lohr</a> that summarized: <q>Much of the history of computer programming can be seen as the effort to expand the franchise -- to make it easier for more people to program.</q></p>
          <p>My <a href="http://programme2013.scottishrubyconference.com/slots/3/video"> talk at SRC </a> focused on how we 'Grow Programming', how we can accomplish more individually and how we can bring more people to programming. When we improve our languages and tools, we make it possible for people to solve their own problems using computers. We also have to fight the perception of programming and programmers that push away the people who we could be teaching.</p>

          <h2>Fluent 2013</h2>
          <p>One of the projects I worked on at <a href="http://modcloth.com"> ModCloth </a> was a backbone app that we built to be almost all of the tablet site experience. We hoped that by avoiding full page refreshes we could create an experience that felt snappy and responsive.</p>
          <p>We were very driven by performance concerns, but, when we launched it, realized we had no RUM (Real User Monitoring) in place to confirm our observation that it was faster. And making things worse, because we were never refreshing the page, the site performance information being sent to New Relic was all over the place.</p>
          <p>This yak-themed talk, <em>Benchmarking the New Front End: How to Quantify Single Page App Performance</em>, given with <a href="https://twitter.com/eanakashima">Emily Nakashima</a> is a performance talk, targeted at a mostly front-end audience. We ended up having to roll our own solution to front-end performance monitoring because the tools we take for granted on the server-side aren't yet available for monitoring client responsiveness.</p>
          <p>Since <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013/public/schedule/detail/27996">this</a> was part of an O'Reilly conference, the video is a little pricey. Our  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eanakashima/benchmarking-the-front-end-expanding-what-performance-means-and-how-to-track-it">slides</a> are available on slideshare. And for extra reading, we collected all our references in <a href="bit.ly/ostrichandyak">a bitly bundle</a>.</p>

          <h2>Velocity 2013</h2>
          <p>After preparing our talk for Fluent, we realized that our message was not only for the front-end community; it's just important to make sure to make sure that the people who "own" performance understand that no matter how great server performance is, if the client has become slow or even unresponsive, the site performance isn't really being tracked at all.</p>
          <p>(And if you're not measuring how users are actually experiencing your site, you're burying your head in the sand. Hence the Ostrich theme.)</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/eanakashima">Emily Nakashima</a> and I intended this talk, <em>Benchmarking the Front End: Expanding What Performance Means and How to Track it</em>, for an audience composed of more Operations folks, and people who care about the full performance story. Some of the content overlaps with the Fluent talk, but we don't assume knowledge of javascript.</p>
          <p>Because <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/detail/28383">this</a> was an O'Reilly conference, the video is behind a pay wall. But our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eanakashima/performance-monitoring-for-the-new-front-end-bullets">slides</a>, <a href="bit.ly/ostrichandyak"> references, and further reading</a> are purusable.

          <h2>Wicked Good Ruby 2013</h2>
          <p>After reading two blog posts about how Ruby caches method lookups within a few months of each other, one by <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2013/4/14/mris-method-caches.html">James Golick</a> and one by <a href="https://charlie.bz/blog/things-that-clear-rubys-method-cache">Charlie Somerville</a>, I decided to dig in and learn about the Ruby internals for a talk at Wicked Good Ruby.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/sheenathejunglegirl">Sheena McCoy</a>, and I wanted to collaborate together since we found ourselves always working on separate projects at ModCloth, and seized this opportunity.</p>
          <p>The <a href= "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMR0TEh9W2U">video</a> is available, though I step on my first joke out of the gate and it's terrible. There are also <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rachelmyers/understanding-rubys-method-cache">slides</a> if that's your style. Or check out the references <a href="bit.ly/rubymethodcache">references and reading</a> we helpfully assembled. :)

          <h2>Rails Girls, Milan</h2>
          <p>In a stroke of amazing luck, I got to travel to Milan, Italy for a RailsGirls workshop! I met amazing developers, men and women, from all Italy and Europe.</p>
          <p>I was asked to give a short talk, but was intimidated. The little I knew about Italy suggested the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Patriarchy" class="extra-special">Patriarchy</a> was as strong as ever, and I wasn't sure I had something useful to say. Then I realized that I grew up in Texas; between the oil industry and cowboys, I'm an expert in the Patriarchy!
          <p>My talk, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rachelmyers/learning-hard-and-amazing-things"><em>Learning Hard (and Amazing!) Things</em></a>, was everything I wish I had known when I started learning to program.</p>
          <p>Determiniation solves way more problems than being smart, whatever smart is. It's awesome to pair and collaborate, but I learn my limits and experiment more creatively when I struggle with a problems independently as well.</p>
          <p>And most importantly, women are more likely to encounter people who will subtly (or not), unintentionally (or not) say things that will feel so shitty you'll want to quit programming. And at those points, it's better for you and for the community of programmers if you put your foot down, and refuse to leave. We all need the grit to put up with assholes, and stubborness to sometimes fight back.</p>
          <p>I was definitely on my soapbox. :) </p>

          <p>No word yet on what adorable animal drawings we'll use for the presentation. I'm hoping for squirrels.</p>

          <p>The conference will be on the theme of mistakes we've made, so I have lots of material to choose from.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> is an organization that teaches women (and anyone else who can make the tech community more diverse) Ruby, Rails, and now HTML, CSS. (There's a <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/tree/js-tutorial">javascript curriculum</a> in the works if you'd like to contribute.)</p>
          <p>The RailBridge community and workshops were a huge help to me when I started programming, and I started teaching as soon as I was able.</p>
          <p>Now I help by connecting San Francisco organizers with offices willing to host workshops and companies or foundations that can make donations. (I'm working on automating these things away, but until then,) <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a> if you'd like to be organize, host or sponsor a workshop in San Francisco.</p>
          <p>I also help out by connecting people outside San Francisco that would like to have workshops with experienced organizers who can mentor them, walk them through the <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/Cookbook">Workshop Cookbook</a>, and be general moral support!</p>
          <p>If you're interested in organizing, no matter where, it's super helpful to join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railsbridge-workshops">RailsBridge Google Group</a>, and maybe even participate in one of our Sunday calls with people around the world!</p>
